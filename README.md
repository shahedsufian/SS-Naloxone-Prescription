# Naloxone Prescription in Response to the Opioid Epidemic

## About the project
In response to the opioid epidemic, policies to expand access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone have emerged across the country. In Arkansas, Act 651 of 2021, which went into effect on July 28, 2021, requires a co-prescription of naloxone in certain situations, including when a dosage for an opioid prescription is 50 or more morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day. In 2017, licensed pharmacists became authorized to dispense naloxone to individuals without a prescription under a state protocol.
This project conducted annual analyses of naloxone and opioid prescriptions for Medicaid and commercially insured enrollees. Data for the analyses are from the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database, for state fiscal years (FY) 2017 to 2024. An updated data watch will be publish to present the results of this project. Data watch prepared from the earlier analyses of FY 2017 to 2023 is available here https://achi.net/publications/data-brief-naloxone-prescription-in-response-to-the-opioid-epidemic-2.

The output contains a trend of High Dose Opioid (HDO) prescriptions and HDO prescriptions with a Naloxone prescription. Additionally, the number of pharmacy authorized Naloxone prescriptions (State) is available as output.
